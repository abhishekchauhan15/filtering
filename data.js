      "Performance was blazing quick too. Even with all its bells and whistles, FunTouch OS ran smoothly and was easy to master. I also found the biometrics to be very reliable, be it the fingerprint sensor or face recognition. Videos looked great on the phone's display, especially HDR content.",
      "One of the best looking phone in the market right now with a decent performance jump from 11 pro. Camera is excellent and the display is quite responsive and sharp. Only issue is it does not have a higher refresh rate and the battery life is average.",
      "I have upgraded from Android to iOS for the first time with the IPhone 12 Pro. And the experience is very much satisfactory. The new A14 bionic processor is very fast. The boxy design is what I liked the most. The camera and display are top notch. Night mode photography is excellent. Worth upgrading from Android to iOS .",
      "Awesome! Just made an upgrade from X, worth every single penny spent on it, the camera is just too superb, be it the selfie cam or the main rear cam, the goodness it takes the picture is just beyond words, no smart phone can beat it atm! However, the battery life tends to be on the shorter side, that’s the only con that I can’t think up of now.",

      `Good mobile poco m3
        Pros:
        Fullhd display,
        smooth tocuh response,
        6000mah battery,
        avarage weight,
        back disign amazing,
        no heatting issue,
        decent back camera
        Excellent sound quality it's very clear
        Cons:
        front camara not take a clear picture,
        Charging time to long .50% charging time 1 hour 35 minutes.
        Ovarall the price segment this mobile good`,
      "Sound quality super 3 type sound but camera selfie camera is not good &Back camera is normally or value of money. Totally side & angel to seen to parfect",
      `One word review " Value for Money"
        It has the potential to be a nice casual daily driver
        Speakers are loud...like seriously loud.
        Screen size is good
        Though being a LCD screen it produces decent colours. For the price at which it comes that more than enough.
        Camera is neither the best nor the worst, it's quite good for this price point.
        6000 mA battery 🔋👍🏻
        Though it comes with a lot of bloatware but you can just uninstall most of them (excluding system apps)
        Finally the Verdict is that it's a good budget smartphone`,

      `1.Very Smooth user interface.
        2. Gives you easily Two Days of battery backup with average use.
        3. Hepatic feedback too good.
        4. In this price range Rear camera is Above average. Hope it should be improve in future updates. & Front camera perform very well.
        5. In hand feel is little bulky, it feel heavier than other phone due to its big 6000 mah battery
        6. Display size is very big ( 6.8 inches ) & bright.
        7. Voice call quality is very good & clear.
        8. Notification LED light is missing, but Previous Motorola phones have led notification light.
        9. You will definitely love the gesture controls of this phone.
        10. It is splash proof & water repellent design.
        
        Over all this phone is value for money
        Go for it ...`,

      `One of the best smartphones of 2020 with reasonable price
      Works smooth as butter
      Camera is undoubtedly the best in prices segment or say any smartphone camera.
      Haptics are awesome
      Battery may need sometime to give you a full day of use as adaptive battery software takes time to learn the way you use the apps and phone
      Size and built quality are gonna impress you when you see it.
      Charging speed is quite fast.
      Overall the best android experience you can ever imagine.`,

      "Performance was blazing quick too. Even with all its bells and whistles, FunTouch OS ran smoothly and was easy to master. I also found the biometrics to be very reliable, be it the fingerprint sensor or face recognition. Videos looked great on the phone's display, especially HDR content. ",
      "Best Samsung phone in this price range.Good battery back up.Decent Display.Fast fingerprint sensor.Rear camera quality is good.front camera is not up to the mark.90 Hz refresh rate is good.Good user interface.updated to one ui 3.1.there are some pre installed apps which can only be disabled.sound quality is low comparing with other smartphones in same price segment.using in low screen bightness noticed screen flickering.",
      "First I would like to thank you Flipkart for fastest delivery and yah the delivery guy is so cooperative and helpful. Samsung phones are always best in performance and this one is also affordable and awesome phone",

      `
        Pros:
        1. Very ultra premium features at this price range of 30k and pretty much matching features with higer range one plus models.
        2. The display is just great.
        3. Screen refresh rate you can actually feel to be fast @90Hz.
        4. No heating issue in phone or the charger till now.
        5. They are giving a back cover with the phone, which is pretty good actually with bumps in side and camera portion which actually saved my phone from a direct fall on a rough floor that too on screen side..and no scratches at all!!..so the cover's tested guys😂and it actually feels elegant. ,
        "First I would like to thank you Flipkart for fastest delivery and yah the delivery guy is so cooperative and helpful. Samsung phones are always best in performance and this one is also affordable and awesome phone",
         Cons:
        1. They could have provided a little higher battery capacity like those in Samsung phones coz of Such a high resolution display and refresh rate..but it could have increased the weight of phone..so its pretty much understandable.
        Battery back up is some what 12-14 hrs which I got on continuous usage..like songs.. attending meetings on teams.. Netflix etc. But since it gives so..so..so.. fast charging u just wont feel it.
  
        2. No earphone jack..If that is a con to u..not for me actually😂
        Nothing else serious issue this phone has got me into till now .So that it guys..If i find anything else after prolonged Usage I will honestly put it here.
        So I will say if you wanna buy a phone above 50k just dont..buy this if you budget is ~25k stretch it a lill and buy this Nord 2.

        Pros:
       - Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!
  - Display is excellent with Blue light filter.
  - Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.
  - 6000 Mah battery is BIG
  - 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.
  - Both dedicated sim slots support LTE
  - Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.
  - Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.
  - Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.
  - Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good
  - Received next day by 11 AM !
  Cons:
   Not that thin, but ok.
  - Doesn't have Samsung Dex
  - Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.
  - Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :)
  - Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.
  
  Feedback
  
  - Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.
  - Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now. (Aug 2021 - excellent, no
